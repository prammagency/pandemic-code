# PSC to DreamBot API Integration: Consolidated Project Documentation

## Project Overview

We're building an AI-driven system for Pandemic Script Creator (PSC) that generates error-free RuneScape automation scripts through:
- LangFlow with agents
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Memory integration

The goal is to enable an AI system to generate syntactically correct and semantically accurate PSC JSON scripts for RuneScape automation tasks by providing it with comprehensive context about:
- PSC JSON structure and conventions
- DreamBot API integration
- Game-specific references and anti-ban techniques

Our vision is not to dictate a single method to the AI but to empower it with comprehensive context so it can "free think, expand, ruminate, validate, and execute" with full context. Rather than fine-tuning a local LLM, we're using a LangFlow-hosted AI model with RAG and memory integration to generate PSC JSON scripts on the fly.

## Key Data Sources

### 1. DreamBot API Documentation
- Classes, enums, and interfaces extracted from javadocs
- Contains the underlying API calls that PSC actions map to
- Location: `D:\RS_AI\ALL DOCS\Dreambot Api Docs- Classes_Enums`
- The structured_entities.json file maps packages to their respective classes, enums, and interfaces
- Each URL in this file points to a javadoc page containing definitions, descriptions, and structural details
- We've successfully extracted and processed most of the API documentation with a 98% completion rate (450 out of 459 files)

### 2. Enriched Pandemic Code
- Actual internal code from Pandemic Script Creator
- Shows the exact JSON output format rather than the Pascal-like UI display
- Obtained by downloading every action/option available directly from the software
- Location: `D:\RS_AI\ALL DOCS\enriched_code - Pandemics code`
- Files include various categories like banking, combat, entities, inventory, logic, etc.
- This reveals the exact structure of how PSC writes its code when scripts are exported

### 3. Cleaned PSC Documentation
- Processed documentation from the PSC website
- Includes action descriptions and usage examples
- Location: `D:\RS_AI\ALL DOCS\cleaned_docs - pandemic docs`
- Provides clear explanations of actions, usage examples, and details about PSC's unique JSON DSL
- Error-free and processed for optimal reference

### 4. Mapping Files
- ActionID_CategoryMap.json linking actions to categories
- Correlations between PSC actions and DreamBot API functions
- Maps action identifiers like "log" to categories like "guides/editor" or "comment" to "variables/lists"
- Essential for creating proper action hierarchies and relationships

## Core Concepts

### PSC JSON Structure vs. Standard JSON
- While PSC scripts obey standard JSON syntax, they are not mere static key-value data files
- Each script is a dynamic, hierarchical representation of bot logic
- Custom action "id" values (e.g., "IF_BANK_IS_OPEN") define operations
- Nested "children" arrays implement hierarchical control flow (conditionals, loops)
- "properties" objects contain configuration parameters for each action
- Complex filtering systems use a structured format with class, logic, type, and operator

### Pascal-Like UI vs. JSON Output
- The PSC UI presents a Pascal-like visual flow with block structures (similar to BEGIN/END)
- What's exported is actually JSON that the PSC runtime interprets
- Our training focuses on this JSON structure, not on any literal Pascal code

### Categories of Functionality
- Banking operations (bank.json) - Bank deposits, withdrawals, opening/closing banks
- UI interactions (widget.json) - Interface interactions and menu handling
- Variable handling (variables_list.json) - Creating, setting, and manipulating variables
- Entity interactions (entities_player.json, entities_npcs.json) - Interacting with game objects and characters
- Control flow (logic section.json) - AND/OR branches, conditionals, loops
- Timing controls (sleep.json) - Various sleep mechanisms for timing and anti-ban
- Ground items (entites_ground_items.json) - Picking up items from the ground
- Movement (walking.json) - Navigation and teleportation
- Combat related actions - Targeting, attacking, and combat settings

### Filtering System
We've identified all filter classes and their operators:
- Item filters (NAME, ID, STACKABLE, NOTED, VALUE, etc.)
- NPC filters (NAME, ID, LEVEL, DISTANCE, INTERACTING, etc.)
- GameObject filters (NAME, ID, DISTANCE, ACTION, TYPE, etc.)
- GroundItem filters (NAME, ID, DISTANCE, STACKSIZE, etc.)
- Player filters (NAME, LEVEL, DISTANCE, etc.)
- Various logical operators (EQUALS, NOT_EQUALS, CONTAINS, GREATER_THAN, etc.)
- Logical combinations: AND, OR, NONE

## Implementation Framework

### 1. Standardized Libraries
We've created four core libraries to standardize and validate PSC scripts:

#### Action Hierarchy Library
- Comprehensive catalog of all PSC actions with the structure:
```json
{
  "action_categories": ["banking", "combat", "entities", ...],
  "actions": {
    "ACTION_ID": {
      "category": "category_name",
      "description": "Detailed description",
      "can_be_root": true|false,
      "valid_parents": ["root", "PARENT_ACTION_1", ...],
      "properties": {
        "required": ["prop1", "prop2", ...],
        "optional": ["opt_prop1", "opt_prop2", ...]
      },
      "valid_children": ["*" or ["CHILD_ACTION_1", ...]],
      "dreambot_api_mapping": {
        "class": "org.dreambot.api.package.ClassName",

    }
  }
}
```

└── output/
    └── java/                      # Generated DreamBot Java code
```

The PSC Standardizer is a highly modular Python tool that handles:

1. **Analysis**: Examines PSC JSON files and generates detailed reports:
   - Action structure and nesting validation
   - Property completeness checking
   - Filter validation against reference libraries
   - Consistency checking across the entire script

2. **Standardization**: Transforms PSC JSON to match reference libraries:
   - Fixes incorrect nesting structures
   - Normalizes filter configurations
   - Adds missing properties and metadata
   - Standardizes property formats and values

3. **Validation**: Performs comprehensive validation:
   - JSON schema validation
   - Semantic validation (parent-child relationships)
   - Filter validation against reference libraries
   - Runtime simulation to detect potential infinite loops

4. **Code Generation**: Creates DreamBot Java code from standardized PSC JSON:
   - Maps PSC actions to DreamBot API calls
   - Translates PSC properties to DreamBot method parameters
   - Converts PSC logical structures to Java control flow
   - Handles special cases and exceptions

The tool is designed to be used from the command line with options:
```bash
# Analyze a PSC JSON file
python psc_standardizer.py analyze --input-file ../data/raw/example.json --output-file ../data/analysis/example_analysis.json

# Standardize a PSC JSON file
python psc_standardizer.py standardize --input-file ../data/raw/example.json --output-file ../data/standardized/example_std.json

# Validate a standardized PSC JSON file
python psc_standardizer.py validate --input-file ../data/standardized/example_std.json --output-file ../data/analysis/example_validation.json

# Generate DreamBot Java code
python psc_standardizer.py generate-code --input-file ../data/standardized/example_std.json --output-file ../output/java/ExampleScript.java
```

We've also created a batch processing script to handle multiple files:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Batch processing script for PSC JSON files
# Process each JSON file in the raw directory
for file in "$RAW_DIR"/*.json; do
    # Get filename without path and extension
    filename=$(basename "$file" .json)
    
    echo "Processing $filename..."
    
    # Analyze
    python psc_standardizer.py analyze --input-file "$file" --output-file "$ANALYSIS_DIR/${filename}_analysis.json"
    
    # Standardize
    python psc_standardizer.py standardize --input-file "$file" --output-file "$STD_DIR/${filename}_std.json"
    
    # Validate
    python psc_standardizer.py validate --input-file "$STD_DIR/${filename}_std.json" --output-file "$ANALYSIS_DIR/${filename}_validation.json"
    
    # Generate code
    python psc_standardizer.py generate-code --input-file "$STD_DIR/${filename}_std.json" --output-file "$JAVA_DIR/${filename}.java"
    
    echo "Completed processing $filename"
done
```

        {
          "id": "WALK_TO_BANK",
          "properties": {
            "Bank": "Edgeville Bank"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
## Implementation Next Steps

### Immediate Actions for Standardization Framework

Now that we've fixed the path resolution issues in our scripts, we need to execute the following steps to complete our standardization framework:

#### 1. Run the Comprehensive ActionID_CategoryMap Update

We've created a comprehensive ActionID_CategoryMap with over 250 distinct action IDs organized into logical categories. Now we need to:

```bash
# Copy the ActionID_CategoryMap to the correct location
copy action-id-category-map.json mapping\ActionID_CategoryMap.json

# Run the action hierarchy updater to synchronize actions
python scripts\action_hierarchy_updater.py --base-dir .

# Validate the synchronization
python scripts\action_sync_validator.py --base-dir . --check-scripts
```

This will ensure that our action hierarchy library contains entries for all actions in the category map.

#### 2. Organize and Process the Raw PSC Files

With our framework in place, we can now properly organize and process the raw PSC files:

```bash
# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p data\raw\sample
mkdir -p data\organized
mkdir -p data\standardized
mkdir -p data\analysis
mkdir -p data\validation
mkdir -p output\java

# Create a sample test file
echo {
  "sleep": "500",
  "name": "Test Banking Script",
  "version": 1.0,
  "actions": [
    {
      "id": "IF_BANK_IS_NOT_OPEN",
      "children": [
        {
          "id": "OPEN_BANK"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
} > data\raw\sample\test_banking.json

# Run the organization script
python scripts\organize_psc_files.py --source-dir data\raw\sample --target-dir data\organized\sample --category-map mapping\ActionID_CategoryMap.json --generate-report

# Run the batch processing script
cd scripts
batch_process.bat --raw-dir ..\data\raw\sample --organized-dir ..\data\organized\sample
cd ..
```

This will demonstrate the complete workflow from raw files to processed outputs.

#### 3. Implement Standardization and Validation Workflow

Once we've tested with sample files, we need to:

1. **Sort all PSC files**: Use the organization script to categorize all our PSC files based on their root action
2. **Run analysis**: Identify potential issues in our PSC JSON files before standardization
3. **Perform standardization**: Convert files to our standardized format and enrich with game-specific data
4. **Validate standardized files**: Ensure all standardized files meet our validation criteria
5. **Generate DreamBot Java code**: Create Java code from our standardized PSC scripts

### Building the RAG Knowledge Base

After completing the standardization steps, we'll proceed to build the RAG knowledge base:

#### 1. Extract Chunks from Our Libraries

We need to extract meaningful chunks from:
- Our standardized PSC scripts
- Reference libraries (action hierarchy, filter types, etc.)
- Game-specific libraries (monsters, equipment, locations)
- DreamBot API documentation

#### 2. Create Vector Embeddings

We'll use a suitable embedding model to create vector representations of our chunks:

```python
from langflow.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings

# Initialize embeddings model
embedding_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Create embeddings for all chunks
chunked_documents = []
for library in libraries:
    chunks = semantic_chunking(library)
    for chunk in chunks:
        chunk["metadata"] = enrich_metadata(chunk, libraries)
        chunked_documents.append(chunk)

# Create vector store
vector_store = create_vector_store(chunked_documents, embedding_model)
```

#### 3. Set Up Hybrid Retrieval

Our hybrid retrieval system will combine:
- Vector similarity search
- Keyword-based search
- Entity-based retrieval
- Context-aware re-ranking

### LangFlow Integration Steps

With our knowledge base prepared, we'll integrate into LangFlow:

#### 1. Create Custom LangFlow Nodes

Develop specialized nodes for:
- PSC script generation
- Script validation
- Code translation (PSC JSON to DreamBot Java)
- Game entity lookup (monsters, items, locations)

#### 2. Build the LangFlow Pipeline

Construct a pipeline that connects:
- User input processing
- RAG retrieval
- Script generation
- Validation and feedback
- Memory and context management

#### 3. Test and Refine

Iteratively test and refine the system:
- Start with simple script generation tasks
- Progress to more complex scripts
- Incorporate feedback mechanisms
- Fine-tune retrieval and ranking algorithms

## Implementation Progress and Challenge Resolution

### Key Challenges Addressed and Resolved

#### 1. Nesting Structure Misrepresentation
We identified that the group extraction approach created artificial hierarchies where actions appear nested under other actions, which doesn't accurately reflect PSC's flexible structure. We resolved this by:
- Explicitly marking all action capabilities with `can_be_root` and `valid_parents` attributes
- Creating comprehensive parent-child relationship documentation
- Developing validation rules to prevent incorrect nesting

#### 2. Variable/Filter Value Incompleteness
We found that example PSC files only included specific variable values for select actions, creating inconsistency. We addressed this by:
- Creating a complete Filter Types Library documenting all valid values
- Standardizing filter structures across all action types
- Adding example values for all filter types and properties

#### 3. Operator Library Incompleteness
We discovered that filters in PSC can use various operators that weren't consistently documented. We solved this by:
- Creating a comprehensive operator catalog for each data type
- Documenting the relationship between data types and valid operators
- Adding examples of complex filter combinations

#### 4. AND/OR Branch Inconsistency
We noted logical branches weren't systematically documented. We fixed this by:
- Creating detailed documentation of nesting capabilities
- Defining valid child element rules
- Providing examples of complex condition construction

#### 5. Path Resolution Issues
We encountered issues with file path resolution in our scripts, particularly on Windows systems. We solved this by:
- Implementing script location detection using `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))` 
- Ensuring consistent path handling across all scripts
- Creating robust path resolution that works regardless of working directory
- Supporting both relative and absolute paths for configuration files

### Completed Steps
1. ✅ **Data Collection and Processing**
   - Extracted DreamBot API documentation (98% complete - 450 out of 459 files)
   - Processed Pandemic Code exports from all categories
   - Cleaned PSC documentation from website

2. ✅ **Reference Library Development**
   - Created comprehensive Action Hierarchy Library
   - Developed complete Filter Types Library with all operators
   - Built detailed Control Flow Library with nesting rules
   - Implemented Property Values Library with all formats

3. ✅ **Game Data Integration**
   - Developed standardized Monster Library with location data
   - Created Equipment Library with stats and requirements
   - Built Location Library with coordinates and navigation paths
   - Standardized all location formats (rectangle, path, polygon)

4. ✅ **Tooling Development**
   - Created PSC Standardizer with analyze/standardize/validate/generate functions
   - Developed organization scripts for file management
   - Implemented batch processing capabilities
   - Built validation framework with JSON schema and semantic rules

### Technical Challenge Resolution

We encountered and resolved critical file path issues in our Python scripts:

#### Path Resolution Fixes Implemented

1. **Directory Structure Alignment**
   - Our scripts were looking for files in incorrect locations like "scripts/mapping" and "scripts/libraries"
   - Fixed structure to correctly reference mapping and libraries directories at the root level

2. **Script-Relative Path Resolution**
   - Implemented consistent path resolution using absolute paths based on script location:
   ```python
   script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
   parent_dir = os.path.dirname(script_dir)
   ```
   
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Ensured paths work properly on Windows systems using proper path joining:
   ```python
   os.path.join(parent_dir, "libraries", "action_hierarchy_library.json")
   ```

4. **Flexible Path Handling**
   - Added support for both absolute and relative paths:
   ```python
   if not os.path.isabs(args.category_map):
       script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
       parent_dir = os.path.dirname(script_dir)
       category_map_path = os.path.join(parent_dir, "mapping", os.path.basename(args.category_map))
   else:
       category_map_path = args.category_map
   ```

#### Specific Script Fixes

1. **psc_standardizer.py**:
   - Updated directory resolution in `__init__` method
   - Enhanced library loading mechanism with better error handling
   - Fixed main function to use dynamic path resolution

2. **organize_psc_files.py**:
   - Added missing `Tuple` import
   - Implemented robust category map path resolution
   - Added enhanced error handling for file access

3. **batch_process.bat**:
   - Updated to use parent directory paths:
   ```batch
   set SCRIPT_DIR=%~dp0
   set PARENT_DIR=%SCRIPT_DIR%..
   ```

4. **action_hierarchy_updater.py** and **action_sync_validator.py**:
   - Fixed path resolution to handle cross-directory access

### Current Progress
We have been working on Step 4 of our implementation plan, but haven't fully completed it:

🔄 **Step 4: Organizing raw PSC JSON files for standardization (In Progress)**
- ✅ Created the directory structure for the PSC standardization framework
- ✅ Developed the Python script (organize_psc_files.py) to organize PSC JSON files by category
- ✅ Created comprehensive ActionID_CategoryMap with over 250 actions
- ✅ Completed the monster, equipment, and location libraries as a side task
- ✅ Fixed all path resolution issues in our scripts
- ❌ Haven't yet run the organization script to properly sort all the raw files
- ❌ Haven't validated the raw files before processing

⬜ **Step 5: Using the PSC Standardizer to process files (Not Started)**
- ❌ Haven't analyzed raw PSC JSON files to identify inconsistencies
- ❌ Haven't standardized files according to reference libraries
- ❌ Haven't validated standardized output
- ❌ Haven't generated initial DreamBot Java code samples

### Current Focus
We need to return to Step 4 and complete it properly before moving to Step 5:

1. **Complete Step 4:**
   - Run the organize_psc_files.py script to organize all raw PSC JSON files into appropriate categories
   - Validate the raw files to ensure they're properly formatted for processing
   - Confirm the directory structure is correctly set up

2. **Then proceed to Step 5:**
   - Use the PSC Standardizer to analyze raw PSC JSON files
   - Standardize the files according to our reference libraries
   - Validate the standardized output
   - Generate DreamBot Java code from standardized scripts

2. Create the RAG knowledge base:
   - Implement semantic chunking for documentation
   - Transform standardized libraries into retrieval-friendly documents
   - Add metadata for improved context retrieval
   - Create embeddings for vector search

3. Set up LangFlow integration:
   - Build the LangFlow components for script generation
   - Implement hybrid retrieval system for precise context selection
   - Add memory mechanisms for coherent script generation
   - Develop validation feedback loop

 a LangFlow system that can:
1. Receive user requests for RuneScape automation scripts
2. Retrieve relevant context from our standardized libraries
3. Generate syntactically and semantically correct PSC JSON scripts
4. Validate the generated scripts against our reference libraries
5. Translate the scripts to DreamBot Java code if needed

This system will leverage RAG and memory integration to maintain context across conversations and generate increasingly accurate scripts over time.
